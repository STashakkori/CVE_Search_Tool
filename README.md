# CVE_Search_Tool
This is a Rust applet that searches a local .xml CVE database for entries based on entry number. Enjoy

Download a .xml of the CVE here from MITRE:
https://cve.mitre.org/data/downloads/index.html

Then you can use this tool to search it. Just pass it an entry number and let it work. Returns nothing if not found

Just a heads up that the CVE database is monstrous in size so have some disk free.
